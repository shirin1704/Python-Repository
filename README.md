# Python-Repository
Hi, my name is Shirin. 
I'm currently doing my Bachelor's Degree in Data Science and Big Data Analytics from MIT-WPU, Pune. 
My second semester has a subject called Python.
This is the first time I am actually using Python to code, so this Repository might mainly contains very preliminary programs.
But I shall try to experiment as much as I can with Python so as to be much more savvy with it.
